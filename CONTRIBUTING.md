# Contribution guidelines

<!-- Please don't use relative links in this page, as it is included by github in various places -->
<!-- INCLUSION START -->

The easiest way to contribute is to give us feedback.

* **Something isn't working?** Open a [bug report](https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).
  Rule of thumb: If you're running something and you get some error messages, this is the issue type for you.
* **You have a concrete question?** Open a [question issue](https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent/issues/new?template=question.yml).
* **You are missing something?** Open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)
* **Open-ended discussion?** Talk on [discord](https://discord.gg/AVEFbBn2rH). Note that all actionable items should be an issue though.
