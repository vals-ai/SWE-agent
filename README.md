SWE-agent lets your language model of choice (e.g. GPT-4o or Claude Sonnet 3.7) autonomously use tools to:

* [fix issues in real GitHub repositories](https://swe-agent.com/latest/usage/hello_world),
* perform tasks on the web,
* [find cybersecurity vulnerabilities](https://enigma-agent.com/) (by solving Capture The Flag challenges), or
* [any custom task](https://swe-agent.com/latest/usage/coding_challenges).

It does so by using configurable [agent-computer interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15793) (ACIs) to interact with isolated computer environments.

SWE-agent is built and maintained by researchers from Princeton University and Stanford University.

## SWE-agent for offensive cybersecurity (EnIGMA) <a name="enigma"></a>

[SWE-agent: EnIGMA][enigma] is a mode for solving offensive cybersecurity (capture the flag) challenges.
EnIGMA achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple cybersecurity benchmarks (see [leaderboard](https://enigma-agent.com/#results)).
The EnIGMA project introduced multiple features that are available in all modes of SWE-agent, such as the [debugger and server connection tools](https://swe-agent.com/0.7/background/iat/) and a [summarizer](https://swe-agent.com/0.7/config/summarizers/) to handle long outputs. Please use [SWE-agent 0.7](https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent/tree/v0.7) while we update EnIGMA for 1.0.
