# SWE-agent overview

SWE-agent implements an AI agent that runs over github issues.
Here's what you need to know about the project structure:

- The main entry points to running are in the `sweagent/run`, in particular `run_single.py` and `run_batch.py`
- The main class that governs agent behavior is `sweagent/agent/agents.py`
- The AI agent proposes actions that are executed in sandboxed docker containers
- At the beginning of an agent class, we initialize a `SWEEnv` class from `sweagent/environment/swe_env.py`. This class interfaces with the SWE-ReX project to interface with the sandboxed docker containers
- Part of the SWE-agent project are tools in `tools/`. They are organized in bundles. These bundles are copied to the sandboxed container and made available in the $PATH variable.
