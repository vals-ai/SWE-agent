 --------------------------------
 
 There are a few settings which control Django's file upload behavior. See
+.. note::
+
+    Be aware that the permissions of uploaded files and directories can vary depending on whether the file is stored in memory or as a temporary file on disk (controlled by :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS` and :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`). By default, Django sets file permissions to ``0o644`` and directory permissions to ``0o755``. However, if not explicitly configured, temporary files created on disk may inherit restrictive permissions (e.g., ``0o600``) from the system's temporary file creation defaults. To ensure consistent permissions, explicitly set :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` and :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS` in your project settings.
 :ref:`File Upload Settings <file-upload-settings>` for details.
